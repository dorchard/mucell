**Interdisciplinary Research in Modelling and Simulation of Cell Spatial Behaviour**

---

## Overview

muCell is a research project focused on modelling and simulating the spatial behaviour of cells. This interdisciplinary work combines computational modelling, biology, and simulation techniques to better understand how cells interact within their environments. The project aims to provide insights into cellular dynamics by creating robust spatial models that can be used for further biological research and educational purposes.

This repository contains the code, models, and documentation related to the muCell project, originally published in:
